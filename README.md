# GTA-SA-mods
This is a simple python script to replace GTA San Andreas mod configurations such as car's speed, weight etc. 

> 1) Grab the files you want to modify from <kbd>[game_folder]/data/</kbd>.

> 2) Create the files with your custom data (It usually comes in readme) and save them in a folder called <kbd>mod/</kbd> (same level as script).

> 3) Run <kbd>python script.py</kbd> and it will generate the new files.

> 4) Copy the files in <kbd>new/</kbd> to the <kbd>[game_folder]/data/</kbd> directory.

**This scrypt doesn't modify the original data structure, but it can damage the final result because of external causes (malformed mod files, etc) we highly recommend you to save a copy of the original files in another path **
