# GTA-SA-mods
This is a simple python script to replace GTA San Andreas mod configurations such as car's speed, weight etc. 

Just drop the current files in the "old" directory and the mod's files in the "mod" folder.
The names should match, so if you want to change handling settings, you should get all the spects you want and add them to the "mod/handling.cfg" file.

Then, you will have to copy the folders generated in the "new" folder to the hame folder [game_folder]/data/
